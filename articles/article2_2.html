<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Linguistic selection in advertising, especially the focus on  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gendered</span> language, is the main concern in this study. The main concentration in the research is the investigation into the use of specific verbal items in commercials to confirm the idea that there are differences among adverts of similar products for either male or female consumers. The result of this paper can partly contribute to industrial areas as well as other academic fields such as <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview>sociolinguistics</span>. The conclusion supported by a qualitative research will lead to a confirmation of the thesis together with some practical implications.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A product on the way of reaching consumers needs a great deal of support from advertising. In the process of editing a commercial, together with visual effects, the choice of linguistic items is a significant factor which can affect audience’ critical thinking and selection. As a result, the investigation into verbal patterns, especially the impact on  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> issues, will act as a useful tool for the development in both marketing business and sociolinguistics. The outcome of the research highlighted the focus of  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> language use and its effects over the marketing success of a product as well as the perceptions of the public towards a commercial.
</p>

<h2>Literature review</h2>
<p>Despite the given <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="social" data-label="social" data-sort="social">social</span> status and speech community, the viewpoints towards  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> may be involved in various forms of languages to communicate. It is the difference in the language use which results in linguistic diversity in various aspects of life. While linguists just focus only on linguistic features specific in  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> language, people working on advertising industry tend to find out how to develop these features to take of advantage for their own business.
</p>

<h3>Gender in language</h3>
<h4>Speech differences</h4>
<p>The use of various languages due to the differences in  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span>. In one of the linguistic investigation by Janet Holmes (2008, p.87) of the Amazon Indian's speech, the husband's language considered as the “mother tongue” for his children was completely distinguished from his wife's speech. The man used his Tuyuka to communicate with other members in the community and with his family while the woman only referred her tribal Desano language to talk to her husband. It is the highlight of two or more languages used at the same time in the community speech based on the  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> distinction which shows the linguistic boundary in this area.
</p>

<p>The use of various forms in the same linguistic group. Earlier investigations have shown that women tend to be more polite and formal in most conversations they make whereas this level seems to be lower in male use of speech. A survey conducted in Japan (Ide, 1992, p. 119) showed that the <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="social" data-label="social" data-sort="social">social</span> conventions could determine the frequency of polite choice while the  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> decides the form of language use.
</p>

<p>Nowadays, the language choice of forms by male and female speakers is also varied. Beside the word selection, the pronunciation and the formation of sentences are also highlighted. Like sajiao, for example, in Taiwan settings, there are softer articulator contact, weaker aspiration, shorter pronounced duration, higher frequency of sentence-final particles, more spoken utterance speed, etc. (Chan, 1998, p. 40)
</p>

<em>Reason for differences</em>

<p>Social status. Women tend to realize their status in the society deeper than men. They want to use more formal speaking styles to communicate than necessary. Ladies in New York and Norwich, for instance, always respect standard linguistic forms to obtain their own <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="social" data-label="social" data-sort="social">social</span> identity. It is the belief that language can help define class and position in their group which results in the standard variety choice.
</p>

<p>Guardian of society's value. In most cultures, women are considered as ethical models which can be a good mirror to reflect the cultural and traditional values back into the next generation. As a result, in their childhood, girls have to work on the language practice harder than boys to make their words perfect and young women seem to make great efforts to satisfy many standard behavior requirements in their society.
</p>

<p>Subordinate groups must be polite. In hierarchical surrounding, female speakers always have a weaker voice in comparison with men who are considered as more important, powerful and persuasive. Ladies should show their respects and politeness to men and people around them. This is the tradition known as “face-saving” culture in many Eastern countries.
</p>

<p>Vernacular forms. These linguistic structures contain covert prestige. It refers to masculinity, power and toughness. If one of these forms is applied, the attitude towards men's positions becomes positively highlighted.
</p>

<h3>Basic theories followed by researchers</h3>
<p>The deficit theory/ Dominance theory. As its name, this viewpoint considered women's language as an essentially “deficient” compared with male version. This belief dated in the old days, as mentioned by Sadiqi (2003, p. 4), especially came from notions of the “Chain of Being”: God above men, above women and female existence based on men's origin.
</p>

<p>This perspective was supported by many classical linguists and even socio-biologists such as Jespersen (1922, p. 237–254), Wilson (1975, p. 202–216), Hiatt (1977, p. 140) and Butturff & Epstein (1978, p. 127–133). Among them, Lakoff's writing established the science about  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> and language which was considered as a high feministic investigation for the beginning era of this theory. He emphasized the lack of authority and assertiveness in female styles whereas the dominance of male speech widened in different aspects of life: politics, trade and entertainment. The concept of “saving face” among women is also a significant factor which has a great effect over their language use. It is their “double bind” that put a pressure on ladies’ speech and behaviors.
</p>

<p>Lakoff's point of view has influenced lots of his followers. To develop his attitudes, Freeman & McElhinny (1996, p. 232) highlighted three main categories which resulted in women's verbal behaviors: resource shortage, outside encouragement and <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="social" data-label="social" data-sort="social">social</span> requirements. Besides, a list of Lakoff's main claims and ideas about female language was provided to clarify the deficiency in women's language power. Later, the male dominance in interaction and interruptions were mentioned as “a device for exercising power and control in conversation” (Zimmerman & West, 1975, p. 103). Some specific features in female language (e.g. hedges) were also noted by Preisler (1986, p. 104) and the settings when they are used. (Coates, 2004, p. 146–170).
</p>

<p>The difference theory. In another point of view which is nearly opposite to the previous theory, the opinion in this tendency supports “positive” attitude towards women's speech with many analyses of special features in female language in comparison with men's words. One of the hypotheses proving the idea that women were more cooperative and sympathetic then men was suggested by Kalcik (1975, p. 7). Thanks to their “gentle” verbal behaviors, the humors and connections among speakers are tied.
</p>

<p><span id="mention-" class="mention person" about="Troemel-Ploetz" data-label="Troemel-Ploetz" data-sort="Troemel-Ploetz">Troemel-Ploetz</span> (1994, p. 201–204) also emphasized the collaboration and mutual support in conversations by female speakers while the balance of the speaking rights were equal among all the speech participants. According this argument, the weaker voice mentioned in the previous theories contains all good qualities enough to help its speakers to be modest, fair, honest and respectful to handle the linguistic power. Another proof of different style but equal rights among speech community members was given by Maltz & Borker (p. 196). With their investigation into verbal and non-verbal behaviors (e.g. minimal responses, hesitation signals, etc.), they discussed the different interpretations from speakers of opposite  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">genders</span>. Therefore, the problems in communication take place not merely because of the distinguished cross sex talks but due to the misunderstanding by the speech participants. On the same side of the argument, Tannen (1990, p. 240–278) told a story about the two worlds felt by men and women. While men illustrate the world with hierarchical orders, women depict their world where there is a lack of negotiations but full of sympathy and cooperation. However, this opposition makes the author's words less persuasive and critical. Among her critics, Eckert and McConnell- Ginet (1992) note that the difference in cross sex conversations took place because of multi-strategies people used to create dominance.
</p>

<p>In two different theories, Lakoff and Tennen showed their weak points of evaluation and consideration. The notice of language use in conversations were mentioned but the  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> connection which is the main reason resulted in the verbal choice was not highlighted. The linguistic analysis was not combined with the contextual settings where the talks were conducted. In other words, the conversational situations can play a significant role in effecting the language differences.
</p>

<p>Social Constructivist Theory. The connection by linguistic conventions with their contexts is considered as the key point to evaluate any relationship between languages and <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="social" data-label="social" data-sort="social">social</span> figures. Thanks to this reality, there was a new tradition which created a new theory of  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> language. The field of constructivism was involved with many different aspects of <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="social" data-label="social" data-sort="social">social</span> sciences (e.g. education, sociology, cognitive psychology, etc.). It emphasized the “shifts from the individual as meaning maker of the interaction between individual and environment” (Sivan, 1986, p. 211) and from then collected the actual meaning of the conversation.
</p>

<p>During the 90s, many researches and theoretical statements have been highlighted. In most of cases, the relationship between the linguistic circumstances and language patterns were logically connected. Goodwin (1990, p. 109) defined “activities” in speech community and argued that the stereotypes of women's speech should not be examined separately from its events or <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="social" data-label="social" data-sort="social">social</span> conventions. As a result, the speakers’ styles were based mainly on the atmosphere around rather than the individual speaking habits. Similar conclusions were also drawn by Edelsky (1981, p. 20–31). This linguist provided evidences to show that natural language competence could happen in different contexts, including institutional and conventional <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="social" data-label="social" data-sort="social">social</span> tasks.
</p>

<p>Thanks to this modern point of view, a plenty of development took place in many life aspects. In language teaching and learning, for example, the mechanism happening in the language acquirement could be reduced (Palincsar, 1998, p. 350). Moreover, the cognitive interaction and linguistic construction can be speeded up in the learning process whereas the observation of hierarchical order in language use can be very helpful for children to adapt to the surrounding <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="social" data-label="social" data-sort="social">social</span> environment.
</p>

<h3>Gender exposure in advertising language</h3>
<p>There are many special features in advertising language which are partly mentioned as significant points to notice. While most of researchers focus on visual effect of  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">genders</span>, some linguists highlighted the linguistic ideas used in advertisements aim at certain groups of consumers.
</p>

<p>Word choice. The images, colors and other effects over consumer psychology are very important parts in any advertising campaign. However, they can only work if facilitated by words. Brand names, banners and especially the effectiveness how a certain product can offer to its users are always concerns by most of customers. To focus on a specific group of buyers, the producers not only focus on the design but also how to make their “aims” familiar by telling them what they need or what they can have when they buy those things. To female customers, for example, Liu and Westmoreland (2002) observed that the most common words in advertisements are positive–new, good, soft, warm and free are the top five adjectives in female clothing advertisements. The use of “attractive” adjectives (e.g. noticeable, lovely, gentle, etc.) in beauty advertisements are also noticed (Chafai, 2008). Because each sentence in advertising language has to present or emphasize a particular information, it should be effective for approaching the targets (Leech, 1966).
</p>

<p>Preference. First names are one of the most casual forms of addressing the customer in any written or spoken language. However, the choice of forms is not the same between masculine and feminine names. When introduced as “Richard”, a man will be asked to choose to be addressed as “Rich”, “Ricky”, “Richie” or “Dick” (Freeman & McElhinny, p. 222). Which he prefers shows his status and if it is not satisfied, the speaker may be considered as rude or even supposed to insult the listener. On the contrary, women's cases are often ignored and neglected. Choosing the appropriate terms to communicate has become a very efficient contact between manufacturers and their “goals”.
</p>

<p>Naming conventions. The terms and names of addressees are among the most complicated patterns in formal language style. The definitions of “Miss” (for unmarried women), “Mrs.” (for married women and unmarried women with a very high <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="social" data-label="social" data-sort="social">social</span> and professional status), “Ms.” (for unknown women) and “Mr.” (for men, regardless of marital and <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="social" data-label="social" data-sort="social">social</span> status) are still in vague use in some cultures (Hellinger & Bubmann, p. 93). There is also a system for there terms in some hierarchical languages.
</p>

<p>Banner/ slogans. The relationship between word effect and conceptual memory is a significant notice for all manufacturers. The stimulus by “aggressive” words can be powerful for men while the contradictory terms are for women. Working in a research for psychological ads, Luna & Peracchio (2001, p. 285) pointed out that the language can effect not only the attitude but also the choice of the products. Moreover, the remains of the intellectual memory may be speeded up due to the impact of suitable verbal stimulation.
</p>

<p>Due to recent research, the approach to neutral  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> language is of great importance to achieve a higher of consuming effectiveness. However, researchers also notice that any certain specific group of customers have a particular requirements for the language advertised. To do this, applying the  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> language choice in marketing terms are necessary and require an deep understanding of cross sex patterns.
</p>

<p><span id="mention-" class="mention person" about="Leech" data-label="Leech" data-sort="Leech">Leech</span> (1972) noted that an easy way to get close to consumers is through their physical appetites. Therefore, the application of linguistic features in language  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> can be very helpful. Specific verbal choice between men and women in combination with marketing point of view towards sex difference in conversation is a new tendency which can highlight and develop the use of language by speakers from “different linguistic worlds”.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<h3>General perspective</h3>
<p>The main design for this paper is qualitative method. In specific situations, the main purpose of the research is to understand, discover, describe and suggest an appropriate hypothesis and later draw an understandable, academic product (Key, 1997). This type of design is concerned with an empirical documentation through personal observations and experiences. In other words, things are put in its natural setting and interpreted by the naturalistic approach used by the researcher (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994, p. 2). Following this method, the investigation included necessary steps in standard report. As a result, some conclusion was drawn and implications concerned with education and learning strategies.
</p>

<h4>Research objective</h4>
<p>The main objectives in this paper were: to examine possible impacts of stereotypes towards  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> on the language choice in advertisements; moreover, the investigation helps draw attention to special  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> language items used in modern commercials and come to some conclusions and applications concerned with educational patterns.
</p>

<h4>Physical setting</h4>
<p>The main setting in the investigation is in the urban area with high access to available means of communication. All the interviewees interact with ads through a variety of sources (e.g. television, radio, printed products, internet ADSL, etc…). In addition, most of participants can portray the language fluently (in their native language or English) and the commercials they know are among the most popular and up-to-date items.
</p>

<h4>Recruitment of participants</h4>
<p>As the objective mentioned above, the report was involved with theories suggested by Markus et al (1982, p. 45), a certain theoretical group (Calder et al, 1981, p. 201, Miles & Huberman, 1994, p. 218) of one hundred and fifty young adults (75 men and 75 women aged between 20 and 35 from District 5, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam) was interviewed, using a maximal-variation design to obtain the result. All participants are local people (including university students, housewives, public employees and workers from private sectors)
</p>

<p>Sampling method. Because the main strategy used in this paper is convenience sampling, the access to subjects was various and popular in the community. However, because the characteristics and the possibility to represent the whole community are reduced in convenience sampling, the method could be replicated. Due to specific demographic features of interviewees, the reliability of the research can be significantly feasible in the scope of the local setting.
</p>

<p>Human subjects’ statement. Personal information was confidential (without names supplied). All the steps in the research were conducted with a high respect for the limit of confidential terms (Frenkel, Wallen and Hyun, 1990, p.62). Some patterns mentioned by the Committee on Scientific and Professional Ethics of the American Psychological Association were also highlighted.
</p>

<h3>Data collection methods (Instruments)</h3>
<p>Instruments. The main instrument used during the data collection process was interviewing with semi- structured questionnaires (see appendix A). Besides, personal experience form filling was the second device applied for mature subjects. The guidelines and simple directions were recorded as a part of the forms (see appendix B). The commercials applied in the research are extracted from national TV channels with the country's official language used as the main linguistic instrument used in the research. All the ads were selectively chosen between July 2017 and October 2019. In some specific advertisements (i.e beverages, supplement products, etc.) where the  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> of the consumers is not a major factor, the weight of the content and the innovation of the product itself is mainly focused.
</p>

<p>Standard steps. According to basic procedure suggested by Fraenkel et al (1990, p. 429), the research was conducted with necessary steps:
</p>
<p>-
</p>
<p>The identified phenomenon in the study: the differences in advertisements (for the same product) due to the  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> language point of view.
</p>

<p>-
</p>
<p>Participants: include convenience samples in an identified population.
</p>

<p>-
</p>
<p>Generation of hypotheses: was formed and facilitated by the input information provided by the subjects.
</p>

<p>-
</p>
<p>Data collection: simple method (interview, question form) combined with highly interaction between the researcher and her participants.
</p>

<p>-
</p>
<p>Data analysis: sources of information were filtered and then reduced before the thorough analysis and synthesis came.
</p>

<p>-
</p>
<p>Interpretations and conclusions: was briefly described with some personal viewpoints and suggestions.
</p>


<p>Researcher's role. The perspective of the input is not only concerned with the researcher but it also reflects the “outside” setting. Moreover, the readers’ appreciation is also highlighted during the process. In the instrumentation progress, the researcher is the key figure who is responsible for the investigation and its product. Although working as the main motivation for the study, she has to keep in mind the role of natural context in which she is working on. In other words, she should always notice how things occur and try to avoid interfering the inventories. As a result, all the information is thoroughly collected but the last decision is based on the researcher’ personal judgment and evaluation; therefore, subjective experience is noticed (Corbin & Strauss, 1990, p. 42)
</p>

<p>Data organization. The information collected by various techniques is inductively analyzed. However, in this progress, the strategy called “a play of silence” (Mazzei, 2007, p. 22) was not used to construct the data which the researcher hasn't known before. After identifying foreshadowed problems, the random samples, participant location and generated hypotheses were highly expected.
</p>

<p>Data coding procedure. The data analysis is often conducted during and even when the collecting process was finished. Reading or memorizing is a popular way to recycle the information. This is a very effective method for deeper understanding and academic literature review. Besides, information classification or description required close connection and rich complexity of the research. The data interpretation was accomplished when enough meaningful information had been obtained.
</p>

<h2>Data analysis</h2>
<h3>Presentation of results from questionnaire</h3>
<p>A questionnaire and interview questions were very useful facilitators for cross check on the result obtained from the investigation. In this section, the findings were presented and briefly analyzed. In other words, a total of one hundred and fifty samples including one hundred and fifty convenient subjects selected randomly, all of whom are Vietnamese and spend at least 2 hours a day watching TV, and are able to respond individually to the questionnaire.
</p>

<p>The first part in the question focuses on bio-data comprising the information about age,  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> and job, which has an important effect on the answers and comments provided in the forms. In the process of analysis, the input of bio data has a significant role which enables the researcher to get closer to the conclusion. The relationship between participants’ background and their replies will be attached in the table descriptions.
</p>

<p>Table statistics. The questionnaire has 10 questions, which focuses on patterns concerned with  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> language and its use in advertisements. Raw numbers comes on the left and the approximate percentage appears on the right of the table.
</p>

<h2>Data and code availability</h2>
<p>The data and the code for data cleaning and analysis associated with current study remain confidential and keep accordance to national law and regulations, but may be obtained with Data Use Agreements with the Research Ethics Committee of West Liberty University, Faculty of Education. Researchers interested in access to the data may contact Van Bui at vtbui@westliberty.edu. It can take some months to negotiate date use agreements and gain access to the data. The author will assist with any reasonable replication attempts for two years following publication.
</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Because advertising is described as a dangerous test for human critical evaluation (2001, p. 317), the collected data can be a helpful tool to develop advertising techniques as well as the manufacturers’ opinions towards consumers’ shopping psychology.
</p>

<p>As the focus of the study is the specific  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> language used in commercials, the input achieved during the process of investigation concentrated mainly on the viewpoints of interviewees on the advertisements. Due to a series of questions, we can easily realize that most women focus on the language and its features (e.g. accents, voices, intonations, etc.) more than men do. The second noticeable factor is that there are differences in the attention to products. In other words, male customers are often interested in “masculine” products (e.g. cars, household, etc.) while ladies seem to be excited to talk about beauty care products or clothing. Moreover, in the last question, the linguistic patterns used to describe “neutral” items in everyday life were slightly distinguishable. The meta-cognitive experience (Carroll & Luna, 2011, p. 77) by male viewers can be highlighted though verbal advertisements.
</p>

<p>According the previous research (see appendix A: Literature review), this paper can help to confirm the importance of  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> language use in advertising industry as well as the formal application for daily activities. Supported by a variety of linguistic patterns such as message reduction, code mixing, direction functions, and so on, which are regularly used in advert designing (Dattamajumdar, 2006, p. 110), the close connection between  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> and the language choice is the main concern in the questionnaire. Therefore, the information collected can provide a deeper understanding of consumers’ attitudes towards commercials and their effects over the sales. What's more, the fuzziness caused by the mixture of different factors while designing advertisements (Chen, 2011, p. 29) can be accomplished more disciplinarily than expected. Moreover, in areas where different culture groups may share similar features (i.e. Southeast Asia nations) or countries with similar traditional values, the application of this research can be significantly equivalent and effectively feasible. Furthermore, because most commercials came from multinational corporations (i.e. Unilever, Pepsi.Co), the sample may cover much broader aspects and viewpoints of the international community. Therefore, the gap between local participants and other parts of the world can be minimalised.
</p>

<p>Consequentially, above notes can result in some implications. The habit of listening to the language among women can support the success of an advert as long as it has flexible accents which may satisfy different linguistic communities. This idea can enable manufacturers and marketers attract more customers as well as service business can widen their market with new groups of consumers. Because there is not only one type of media which can be accessed (Artz et al, 1999, p.22), the concern with different source of customers should also be noticed. Besides, the consideration of factors affecting on the short-term attention of TV viewers can be developed by appropriate terms together with logical and critical visual facilitators. As a result, the focus on visual and audio effects can help to streghthen the effectiveness of the commercials. On the other hand, Vaicenoniene (2006, p. 45) mentioned that emotional evaluation based on linguistic appeals can give a pleasant initial impression; therefore, to attract interest from both men and women, neutral language can be edited to meet those requirements from consumers.
</p>

<p>In conclusion, the information obtained in this piece of writing plays a vital role in highlighting the relationship between customer's bias and advertising products. However, the image in language or metaphors in advertising were not highlighted and the interacting frequency between participants and modern means of media was not mentioned. The relationship of  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> language choice and its effects should be mentioned in another paper.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Nowadays, advertising has become a blooming industry with demanding requirements for both quantity and quality. To improve the basic quality of any certain adverts, beside graphic effects and content, the language choice is a significant part, which needs to be noticed carefully. The importance of sociolinguistic studies of  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> language used in commercials is always necessary and has proved its impressive contribution to the <span class="keyword" id="keyword-" about="social" data-label="social" data-sort="social">social</span> world development.
